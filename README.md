Performs QR iterations using Gram-Schmidt Process
until eigen values converge within a threshold.
Prints eigen values rounded to 3 decimal points



spec:
Write a programme (in whatever programming
language you prefer) that takes as input a matrix and
computes its eigen-values using the QR algorithm.
The programme should have two main functions
(a) a function that performs the QR iterations
(b) a function that performs QR decomposition using
the Gram-Schmidt process.
